Raspberry Pi B+ Raver Cube

For my project, I'm building a 4x4x4 LED cube with gradient colors. If I get far enough with the hardware, each light will be
uniquely addressable (else, each column of lights will be). The cube will be connected via ribbon cable to raspberry pi B+ GPIO pins. 

The raspberry pi will be running software I've written which takes a wav file as input. It parses the wav file into samples, and reads
odd samples at a rate of ~0.5 seconds. It utilizes the Goertzel algorithm to determine the frequency of the sine wave (tone) for each
read sample, and based on the range of the frequency, lights up a particular set of colors on the cube again via GPIO. I will be using
a GPIO crate for Rust.
