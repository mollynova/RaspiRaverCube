OVERVIEW:

Raspberry Pi B+ Raver Cube

For my project, I'm building a 4x4x4 LED cube with gradient colors. If I get far enough with the hardware, each light will be
uniquely addressable (else, each column of lights will be). The cube will be connected via ribbon cable to raspberry pi B+ GPIO pins. 

The raspberry pi will be running software I've written which takes a wav file as input. It parses the wav file into samples, and reads
odd samples at a rate of ~0.5 seconds. It utilizes the Goertzel algorithm to determine the frequency of the sine wave (tone) for each
read sample, and based on the range of the frequency, lights up a particular set of colors on the cube again via GPIO. I will be using
a GPIO crate for Rust.

SOFTWARE:

Typically, frequencies in music fall in the range of 30Hz ~ 3500Hz. This would be the low end of bass versus
the higher end of a violin. I have 4 colors in my LED cube, Red Blue Green Yellow. Thus, I've divided this 
approximate range of frequencies into four equal quadrants and assigned each a color.

As stated in the overview, I use the 'hound' crate to parse a .wav file into a vector of samples. Each sample
is essentially a sine wave representing the particular frequency of the sample (tone). I read approxiately
one sample per second while the song plays and apply the Goertzel algorithm to it for a number of target
frequencies. The Goertzel algorithm essentially returns a numeric value representing the magnitude, or likelihood that the
given sample is the target frequency. The higher the number it returns, the higher the likelihood. So for each
sample I test, I will apply the Goertzel algorithm to it for 4 different target frequencies. These frequencies 
will be the dead center of each "color quadrant" in my frequency range. Whichever of the 4 returns the highest
magnitude is the frequency that that particular sample is closest to, so I light up the color LEDs associated
with that quadrant.

Computing color ranges: 3500 - 30 = 3470  # total estimated frequency range is 3470Hz
                        3470 / 4 ~= 867   # with 4 colors, each quadrant will be about 867Hz
                        867 / 2 ~= 434    # from the edge of one quadrant to the center of the next, which will be our
                                          # target frequency, is about 434Hz
                        
                        434 + 30 = 464    # 434 plus the offset from our range is the first quadrant target frequency
                        464 + 867 = 1331. # to the center of the next quadrant is the second quadrant target frequency
                        1331 + 867 = 2198 # the third target frequency
                        2198 + 867 = 3065 # the fourth target frequency

Target frequencies:
  Red:    464 Hz
  Yellow: 1331 Hz
  Green:  2198 Hz
  Blue:   3065 Hz 

           
          RED                   YELLOW                       GREEN                      BLUE
|30---Target:434---867||868---Target:1331---1765||1766---Target:2198---2732||2733---Target:3065---3500|

When implementing the Goertzel algorithm, I use a sample rate of 44100Hz, which is standard for most music files. 
Because I'm only reading one sample per second, this isn't particularly important. There could be hundreds of thousands
of samples in a song, so neither the hardware nor my eyes could keep up if I tried to have it display them all.

NOTE: I will likely want to add more variety to my display patterns once I've finished soldering the hardware. My plan is to
create 3 more target frequencies that I'm testing for, which lie in between the initial 4. If a frequency is closer to the
intersection of red and yellow than it is to either red or yellow, I'll probably have it light up both red and yellow lights,
and do the same for yellow/green and green/blue. I might have the red lights start lighting from bottom to top and the yellow
light from top down simultaneously and see what kind of an effect I can get.

HARDWARE:

Layout of the cube:

  -4x4x4 LEDs soldered together, which can be thought of as four 4x4 flat planes of LEDs. 
   The bottom layer is "layer 1" and the top is "layer 4"
   
   The layers are laid out as follows, where R = red, Y = yellow, G = green, B = blue:
   
   Layer 1      Layer 2      Layer 3      Layer 4
   
   B G Y R      G B R Y      Y R B G      R Y G B
   G B R Y      B G Y R      R Y G B      Y R B G
   Y R B G      R Y G B      B G Y R      G B R Y
   R Y G B      Y R B G      G B R Y      B G Y R
   
   For each layer, like colors are all connected together (along with transistors, resistors, and a 12V 3A power supply)
   Each layer has 4 lights of each color
   Each grouping of 4 connected lights per layer is uniquely addressable
   So, this will take 16 GPIO pins. 4 pins will be associated with each color, one for each layer of the cube, and toggled 
   with the rppal crate for accessing GPIO pins in Rust. 
   
   I'm using a 12V 3A external power supply for this project. Red Green and Yellow lights are getting 10V of power and blue
   lights are getting 12V.
