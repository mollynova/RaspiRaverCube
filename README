Raspberry Pi Raver Cube

OVERVIEW:

Raspberry Pi B+ Raver Cube

For my project, I'm building a 4x4x4 LED cube with gradient colors. Each layer of the cube will have 4 sets of 4 LED 
lights soldered together. Each set will be uniquely addressable (16 unique addresses). The cube will be connected via 
ribbon cable to raspberry pi B+ GPIO pins. 

The raspberry pi will be running software which takes a wav file as input and transforms it into a vector of samples. 
This vector of samples will be subdivided into a vector of vectors of samples, each of which has approximately one second
of music's worth of samples, based on the length of the song.

I use RustFFT to perform a fast fourier transform (FFT) on each chunk of samples, deconstructing the sine wave into the 
individual tones it is comprised of. I select the highest of these tones, and turn on the appropriate colored lights on
the cube. Lowest tones are red, low-middle are yellow, middle-high are green, and high are blue.

SOFTWARE:

Typically, frequencies in music fall in the range of 30Hz ~ 3500Hz. This would be the low end of bass versus
the higher end of a violin. I have 4 colors in my LED cube, Red Blue Green Yellow. Thus, I've divided this 
approximate range of frequencies into four equal quadrants and assigned each a color.

As stated in the overview, I use the 'hound' crate to parse a .wav file into a vector of samples. Each sample
is essentially a sine wave representing the particular frequency of the sample (tone). I read approxiately
one sample per second while the song plays and apply the Goertzel algorithm to it for a number of target
frequencies. The Goertzel algorithm essentially returns a numeric value representing the magnitude, or likelihood that the
given sample is the target frequency. The higher the number it returns, the higher the likelihood. So for each
sample I test, I will apply the Goertzel algorithm to it for 4 different target frequencies. These frequencies 
will be the dead center of each "color quadrant" in my frequency range. Whichever of the 4 returns the highest
magnitude is the frequency that that particular sample is closest to, so I light up the color LEDs associated
with that quadrant.

Computing color ranges: 3500 - 30 = 3470  # total estimated frequency range is 3470Hz
                        3470 / 4 ~= 867   # with 4 colors, each quadrant will be about 867Hz
                        867 / 2 ~= 434    # from the edge of one quadrant to the center of the next, which will be our
                                          # target frequency, is about 434Hz
                        
                        434 + 30 = 464    # 434 plus the offset from our range is the first quadrant target frequency
                        464 + 867 = 1331. # to the center of the next quadrant is the second quadrant target frequency
                        1331 + 867 = 2198 # the third target frequency
                        2198 + 867 = 3065 # the fourth target frequency

Target frequencies:
  Red:    464 Hz
  Yellow: 1331 Hz
  Green:  2198 Hz
  Blue:   3065 Hz 

           
          RED                   YELLOW                       GREEN                      BLUE
|30---Target:434---867||868---Target:1331---1765||1766---Target:2198---2732||2733---Target:3065---3500|

When implementing the Goertzel algorithm, I use a sample rate of 44100Hz, which is standard for most music files. 
Because I'm only reading one sample per second, this isn't particularly important. There could be hundreds of thousands
of samples in a song, so neither the hardware nor my eyes could keep up if I tried to have it display them all.

NOTE: I will likely want to add more variety to my display patterns once I've finished soldering the hardware. My plan is to
create 3 more target frequencies that I'm testing for, which lie in between the initial 4. If a frequency is closer to the
intersection of red and yellow than it is to either red or yellow, I'll probably have it light up both red and yellow lights,
and do the same for yellow/green and green/blue. I might have the red lights start lighting from bottom to top and the yellow
light from top down simultaneously and see what kind of an effect I can get.

HARDWARE:

Layout of the cube:

  -4x4x4 LEDs soldered together, which can be thought of as four 4x4 flat planes of LEDs. 
   The bottom layer is "layer 1" and the top is "layer 4"
   
   The layers are laid out as follows, where R = red, Y = yellow, G = green, B = blue:
   
   Layer 1      Layer 2      Layer 3      Layer 4
   
   B G Y R      G B R Y      Y R B G      R Y G B
   G B R Y      B G Y R      R Y G B      Y R B G
   Y R B G      R Y G B      B G Y R      G B R Y
   R Y G B      Y R B G      G B R Y      B G Y R
   
   For each layer, like colors are all connected together (along with transistors, resistors, and a 12V 3A power supply)
   Each layer has 4 lights of each color
   Each grouping of 4 connected lights per layer is uniquely addressable
   So, this will take 16 GPIO pins. 4 pins will be associated with each color, one for each layer of the cube, and toggled 
   with the rppal crate for accessing GPIO pins in Rust. 
   
   I'm using a 12V 3A external power supply for this project. Red Green and Yellow lights are getting 10V of power and blue
   lights are getting 12V.

TESTING:

For the first part of my testing, I'm just making sure the Goertzel algorithm is working properly. I used "audiocheck.net" to
generate and download 1-second-long .wav files at 400Hz, 1400Hz, 2200Hz, and 3000Hz. The first should trigger the "turn on
red lights" condition, the second should trigger the yellow lights, third green, and fourth blue.

My next test, once I knew the algorithm was working properly, was to make sure my rppal code was working as well. I did this in
the breadboard stage of hardware development. I attached my external power supply to power and ground on my breadboard. Then, I
connected the middle transistor pin on a single row of lights to a GPIO pin on my raspberry pi. I wrote a simple tester function
that would use rppal syntax to set that particular GPIO pin to "output" mode, and turn on the lights. 

Once I'd gotten the algorithm working and the lights triggering correctly, everything else was basically just repetition.
